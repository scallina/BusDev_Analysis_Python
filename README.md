# How does weather in Hawaii impact consumer demand for food?

## Overview
In this analysis, I analyzed weather patterns on the Island of Oahu for a client who was interested in opening a seasonal shop. Specifically, I focused on temperature data during the months of June and December to determine of food demand would be the same year-round. 

## Results

## Summary 
According to my analysis, the mean temperature on Oahu only varies by 4 degrees between the months of June and December. With this in mind, the client should strongly consider keeping the shop open year, assuming the demand for ice cream is correlated with weather patterns.
